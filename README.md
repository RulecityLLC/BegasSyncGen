# BegasSyncGen
Sync generator replacement for Bega's Battle hardware.  So that Bega's Battle will work with non-original laserdisc players, including Dexter.

# Introduction
For a full explanation, see http://www.rulecity.com/begas/ .

# PCBs
I created the PCB with Kicad v5.  Newer version of KiCad should work fine.

# VHDL
I've included the VHDL source code programs I wrote for the CPLD.  I built with Xilinx ISE 14.7 which, last I checked, can be obtained for free as a linux VM that runs fine under Windows in VirtualBox.

# Bill of Materials
These are the actual spreadsheets I used when ordering parts for these PCBs.

# Support
If you need help building the VHDL code, programming the CPLDs, or having PCBs made from the KiCad files, I offer commercial support: https://www.daphne-emu.com:9443/mediawiki/index.php/CommercialSupport
